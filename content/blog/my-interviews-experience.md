# My Journey Through Big Tech Interviews

Back in 2022, I've had the privilege of interviewing with some of the most prestigious tech companies in the world. Each experience was unique, challenging, and incredibly rewarding. Here's a quick overview of my journey through NVIDIA, Oracle, and Amazon interviews.

## NVIDIA - SDE 2 (Offer Received ✅)

The NVIDIA interview process was intense but well-structured. What stood out was their focus on **system design** and **GPU computing fundamentals**. The interviewers were genuinely interested in understanding my thought process rather than just the final solution.

**Key Highlights:**
- Deep dive into distributed systems and parallel computing
- Focus on optimization and performance engineering
- Cultural fit assessment with team members
- Emphasis on innovation and research mindset

**What I Learned:** NVIDIA values candidates who can think beyond traditional software engineering - understanding hardware-software interaction is crucial.

## Oracle OCI - SDE 2 (Offer Received ✅)

Oracle's interview process for their Cloud Infrastructure team was comprehensive, spanning multiple rounds focused on **cloud architecture** and **scalability**.

**Key Highlights:**
- Strong emphasis on cloud-native design patterns
- Database and storage system knowledge
- Real-world problem-solving scenarios
- Focus on building reliable, enterprise-grade systems

**What I Learned:** Oracle looks for engineers who understand the complexities of building infrastructure at scale and can balance innovation with stability.

## Amazon - SDE 1 (Interview Experience)

Amazon's interview process is legendary for its **Leadership Principles** integration. Every technical question was paired with behavioral assessment.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data structures and algorithms deep dive
- System design with focus on scalability
- Heavy emphasis on Leadership Principles (Customer Obsession, Ownership, Bias for Action)
- Bar raiser round to maintain hiring standards

**What I Learned:** Amazon doesn't just hire engineers - they hire leaders who can drive impact. Your technical skills must be complemented by strong ownership and customer focus.

## Common Patterns Across All Interviews

After going through these experiences, I noticed several common themes:

1. **Problem-Solving Over Memorization**: Companies care more about your approach than perfect solutions
2. **Communication is Key**: Articulating your thought process is as important as the code itself
3. **System Design Matters**: Even for SDE-1/2 roles, understanding scalability is crucial
4. **Cultural Fit**: Technical skills get you in the door, but culture fit gets you the offer
5. **Preparation Pays Off**: Consistent practice with LeetCode, system design, and behavioral questions is essential

## My Preparation Strategy

- **Daily Coding Practice**: 2-3 LeetCode problems focusing on patterns
- **System Design Study**: Designing popular systems (Twitter, Netflix, etc.)
- **Mock Interviews**: Practicing with peers and using platforms like Pramp
- **Leadership Principles**: Preparing STAR format stories for behavioral rounds
- **Company Research**: Understanding each company's tech stack and culture

## Final Thoughts

Each interview taught me something valuable - not just about technical concepts, but about myself as an engineer. The rejections were learning opportunities, and the offers were validation of consistent effort.

Remember: **Every interview is a learning experience, regardless of the outcome.**
