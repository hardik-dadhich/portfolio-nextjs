      "authors": ["Hardik Dadhich", "Sarah Chen", "Michael Rodriguez"],
      "venue": "International Conference on Web Technologies (ICWT 2023)",
      "year": 2023,
      "summary": "This paper presents a novel approach to automatically identify and optimize React components that would benefit from memoization. Our system analyzes component render patterns and prop dependencies to suggest optimal memoization strategies, resulting in up to 40% performance improvements in real-world applications.",

      "venue": "Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, Vol. 16, No. 3",
      "year": 2023,
      "summary": "We conducted an extensive empirical study comparing popular state management solutions including Redux, MobX, Zustand, and Jotai across multiple dimensions: performance, developer experience, bundle size, and learning curve. Our findings provide evidence-based recommendations for choosing the right state management solution based on application requirements.",

      "year": 2024,
      "summary": "We introduce a set of advanced TypeScript patterns that leverage the type system's inference capabilities to catch more bugs at compile time. Our patterns have been adopted by several large-scale projects and have reduced runtime errors by an average of 35%.",
